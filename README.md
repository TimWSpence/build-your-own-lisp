# Lisp

This started out as my implementation of [Build your own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/). Many thanks to @orangeduck for what is a superb tutorial and something
I would recommend every developer do at some point in their lives.

I have plans to extend it beyond the scope of the tutorial, as per the TODO in this repo.

Thus far, I have added the following:
 - a Makefile so I don't have to remember/keep in my shell history the magic incantation to compile it :)
 - basic file-based I/O via builtins slurp/spit
 - string functions: seq, str, char, int
